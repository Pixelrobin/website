        I have over 5 years of experience bringing websites and apps to life for
        many different clients. I’m based in Bellingham, WA and currently
        working as a nomad from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides working with the web, I love hiking, biking, longboarding, and
        perfecting my coffee brewing technique. I dabble in game development
        too.
