		h1 Technical Stack

		p The website is mostly writting in <em>Pug</em>, which is then compiled to HTML via <em>Gulp</em>. The JavaScript is also transpiled and bundled via Gulp using <em>Webpack</em> and <em>Babel</em>.

		p These tools made editing the site easier and faster. With Pug, I didn't need to have repeatable blocks of markup. With Webpack/Babel I could split up my code, use npm modules, and work with the latest JavaScript specification.

		h1 The Website
		p The design is intentionally <em>Big and Bold</em>. The pale yellow and red colors were chosen to reflect <em>bread and meat</em>. The curves in the logo and layout suggest the <em>rounded</em> shape of a good, packed hoagie.
