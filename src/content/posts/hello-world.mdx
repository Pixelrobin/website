Welcome to my new website! I figured it was time to get more serious about updating it and putting myself out there more.
There's still work to be done on the site, but for now I figure it's better to get this live to keep waiting and tweaking things.

I want to start building a more regular habit of writing. I already have a bunch of ideas for things to write about. Hence the blog.

Stay tuned for more.
