Welcome to my new website! I figured it was time to get more serious about updating it and putting myself out there more.
There's still work to be done around here, but for now I figure it's better to get this live than to keep waiting and tweaking things.

I also want to start building a more regular habit of writing. Hence the blog. Let's see how this goes.

Stay tuned for more.
